## 🕒 Room auto-expiry (TTL)

Planning Poker includes a built-in room TTL (Time-To-Live) system so old rooms automatically disappear from Firebase over time.

### How it works

Each room keeps two timestamps:

- `createdAt` – when the room was first created  
- `updatedAt` – last activity (vote, reveal, emoji rain, story change, etc.)

When someone joins a room, the app checks:

```
if (lastActive && (now - lastActive) > ROOM_TTL_MS) {
    // Room expired → delete it
    await remove(ref(db, `rooms/${currentRoomId}`));
}
```

If the room has been inactive longer than the TTL, it is deleted and recreated fresh.

This prevents your Firebase Realtime Database from filling up with stale test rooms.

### Changing the TTL

The TTL is controlled by a single constant in app.js:

```
// How long a room should live without activity before being treated as expired.
// Default: 24 hours
const ROOM_TTL_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
```

To change the TTL:

| Desired TTL | Replace with |
|-------------|--------------|
| 1 hour      | `const ROOM_TTL_MS = 60 * 60 * 1000;` |
| 12 hours    | `const ROOM_TTL_MS = 12 * 60 * 60 * 1000;` |
| 2 days      | `const ROOM_TTL_MS = 2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;` |
| 7 days      | `const ROOM_TTL_MS = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;` |

You can set any time you like — just adjust the multiplier.

### Why rooms are only deleted on join

Firebase has no built-in cron or scheduled jobs without Cloud Functions.

To keep this app serverless, cleanup happens the next time someone tries to join the room.

This method is lightweight, free, and keeps your database tidy automatically.

## 🧱 Tech stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS  
- **Real-time sync:** Firebase Realtime Database  
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **ES module imports** from the Firebase CDN

Everything runs 100% in the browser.

---

## 🚀 Getting started (local)

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (optional, only if you want to use a local dev server like `npx serve`)
- **Python 3** (optional, for `python3 -m http.server`)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MonsterMatt87/planning-poker.git
cd planning-poker

```

### 2. Create a Firebase project

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com  
2. Create a project (or use an existing one)  
3. Add a Web App  
4. Enable Realtime Database  
5. Copy the database URL (e.g. https://xxxx-default-rtdb.region.firebasedatabase.app)

Make sure your Firebase Realtime Database is in **test mode** (no auth required) or configure rules appropriately for public usage.

### 3. Configure Firebase

At the top of app.js, replace the placeholder config object with your Firebase Web App config:

```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DB_URL",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};
```

### 4. (Optional) Set basic database rules

If you want a lightweight public setup without authentication, these rules match the app’s usage pattern (read/write on rooms) while preventing access to other paths:

```
{
  "rules": {
    "rooms": {
      "$roomId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Serve locally

Because the app uses ES modules, you must run a local server.

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000/
```

## 🧩 How it works

Each room is stored under:

```
rooms/{ROOM_ID}/
  state/
    reveal: boolean
    story: string
    emojiRain: { emoji, at, by }
    createdAt: timestamp
    updatedAt: timestamp
  participants/
    {clientId}/
      name: string
      vote: string
      joinedAt: timestamp
```

Listening clients subscribe to:

- `state/reveal`  
- `state/story`  
- `state/emojiRain` (triggers synced emoji rain)  
- `participants`

Emoji rain sync works by writing:

```
emojiRain: { emoji: "🎉", at: 1710000000000, by: "c_abcd1234" }
```

Every connected tab sees the update and animates the same emoji.

Voting & reveal flow

- Each participant writes their vote to:

```
rooms/{ROOM_ID}/participants/{clientId}/vote
```

- While reveal is false:
  - Right-hand panel shows only … or ✅  
  - Header overlay is hidden
	
- When someone clicks Reveal votes:
  - `state/reveal` becomes true

- Every client:
  - Computes min, max, avg from numeric votes  
  - Renders header cards showing `{name, vote}` for everyone who voted
